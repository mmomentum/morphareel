# Morphareel
_Morphareel_ is a web tool for making "reels" for the [Make Noise Morphagene](https://www.makenoisemusic.com/modules/morphagene/). Audio files can be dragged onto the drop target in the interface, or you can browse through your system using the file picker. Right now this tool is very rudimentary but more will come later.

You can access it via [Github Pages](https://mmomentum.github.io/morphareel/) or you can download the repository and run it directly
